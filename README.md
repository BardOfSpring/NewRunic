# NewRunic

## What is NewRunic?

NewRunic is a custom keyboard layout, made using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, that switches the Latin alphabet on your keyboard at the click of a buton. I found the process of setting up a custom keyboard obstructive, so I ripped the DLLs and setup from the directory straight here. Hope you enjoy!

Make sure to restart your computer once it's installed. :)

  ᛫ the rune Haglaz (ᚺ) has two variants; the second can be accessed using Shift (ᚻ)
  
  . the rune Yngvi (ᛜ) has no real modern transliteration. It therefore fills in for a modern Y key. (the second variant can likewise be     accessed using Shift (ᛝ).
