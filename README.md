# NewRunic

## What is NewRunic?

NewRunic is a custom keyboard layout, made using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, that switches the Latin alphabet on your keyboard at the click of a buton. I found the process of setting up a custom keyboard obstructive, so I ripped the DLLs and setup from the directory straight here. Hope you enjoy!

Note: the current v1.0 is using the Anglo-Saxon fuláš¦orc. Later versions will implement all other variants. Also, make sure to restart your computer once it's installed. :)

## Windows 7
